# ColorFill3DClone
 
 ColorFill3D clone by Gokhan Gumus. Built by using Unity 2019.3.2f1

- 3 levels and a bonus round are created.
- 2 power ups are implemented.
- Rotation movement for enemy cluster is defined.
- %90 of the area should be filled in order to complete level.

Important: Bonus round should be set as last scene in build settings.

Also I've used AurynSky's free asset pack for power up star and diamond meshes. 
Only 2 meshes and materials are used from the pack.
